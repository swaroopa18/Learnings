COMPLEXITY COMPARISON AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Small k (k << n)**: 
   - **MIN-HEAP (Solution 1)** - O(n log k) ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - **PRIORITY QUEUE (Solution 6)** - O(n log k) ✅ ALTERNATIVE (if thread-safety needed)
   - Best space efficiency and performance

2. **Large k (k close to n)**:
   - **QUICKSELECT (Solution 2)** - O(n) average ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Best average case performance

3. **Multiple queries on same array**:
   - **SORTING (Solution 3)** - O(n log n) once, then O(1) per query
   - Or MAX-HEAP for partial sorting

4. **Streaming data**:
   - **MIN-HEAP (Solution 1)** ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - **PRIORITY QUEUE (Solution 6)** ✅ ALTERNATIVE (if thread-safety needed)
   - Can handle continuous data flow

5. **Limited integer range**:
   - **BUCKET SORT (Solution 5)** - O(n) ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Linear time complexity

6. **Multi-threaded environment**:
   - **PRIORITY QUEUE (Solution 6 or 7)** ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Thread-safe operations

DECISION TREE:
- k ≤ log n: Use MIN-HEAP
- k > log n: Use QUICKSELECT
- Need stability: Use SORTING
- Streaming: Use MIN-HEAP
- Limited range: Use BUCKET SORT
- Multi-threaded: Use PRIORITY QUEUE

PRIORITY QUEUE vs HEAPQ:
- PriorityQueue: Thread-safe, cleaner API, slightly more overhead
- heapq: Faster, direct access to elements, not thread-safe
- For single-threaded applications: prefer heapq
- For multi-threaded applications: prefer PriorityQueue

YOUR SOLUTION ANALYSIS:
Your min-heap solution is excellent for small k values and is the most commonly
used approach in practice due to its:
- Predictable performance
- Space efficiency
- Suitability for streaming data
- Clean implementation
