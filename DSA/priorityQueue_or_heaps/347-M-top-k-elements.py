# PERFORMANCE COMPARISON AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

"""
WHEN TO USE EACH APPROACH:

1. BUCKET SORT (Solution2) - RECOMMENDED FOR MOST CASES
   - Best overall performance: O(n) time
   - Use when: General purpose, optimal solution needed
   - Avoid when: Memory is extremely constrained

2. MIN HEAP (Solution1) - GOOD FOR SMALL K
   - Use when: k is small relative to number of unique elements
   - Use when: Streaming data or memory constrained
   - Avoid when: k is large or you need optimal time complexity

3. MAX HEAP (Solution3) - GOOD FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
   - Use when: You need results in frequency order
   - Use when: Learning heap data structures
   - Avoid when: k is small (min heap is better)

4. SORTING (Solution4) - SIMPLE BUT SUBOPTIMAL
   - Use when: Code simplicity is priority over performance
   - Use when: Quick prototype or small datasets
   - Avoid when: Performance matters

5. QUICK SELECT (Solution5) - ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION
   - Use when: You need theoretical O(n) average case
   - Use when: You're familiar with quickselect algorithm
   - Avoid when: Worst case O(n²) is unacceptable

OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:
Use bucket sort (Solution2) for most production code - it's optimal, 
simple to understand, and performs well in practice.
