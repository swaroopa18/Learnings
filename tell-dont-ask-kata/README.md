An example of a solution for Tell Don't Ask kata which I use to teach (pure) OO design.  
I did very small incremental steps (commiting deployable code every minute or so) and ended up with 300+ commits. The idea of baby steps is it serves as an enabling constraint for practicing incremental development skills and reducing inventory of uncommitted and unmerged code.

Description of the kata can be found on [gabrieletondi/tell-dont-ask-kata](https://github.com/gabrieletondi/tell-dont-ask-kata)
